# FoodEx
A small implementation of Factual API.

A simple application that provides an intuitive interface to accomplish the following task:
- User enters a city in a search box and searches for restaurants in that city.
- User sees results in a list view with restaurant name, address, rating, and type.

There is an APK in the repo if you want projects hands on.
